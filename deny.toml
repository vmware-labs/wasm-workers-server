# I'm excluding these packages as cargo deny is failing due to a missing license
# in the package definition [1]. The project license is Apache-2.0 as stated in the
# LICENSE file [2].
#
# I tried to use a license.clarify option to better document this [3]. However, this
# option requires to specify the LICENSE file you're pointing to. Since the crate doesn't
# include the LICENSE file (it's part of the cargo workspace), it cannot find it [4].
#
# For these reasons I added them as excluded packages for now. I introduced this
# exception on https://github.com/vmware-labs/wasm-workers-server/pull/168.
