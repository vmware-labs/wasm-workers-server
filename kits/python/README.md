# Use it with Python

The project already includes the compiled Python engine. To simplify the usage of Python workers, the tool will automatically load this engine and will pass the source code with the request data.

This project is based on the [Python Wasm](https://github.com/vmware-labs/webassembly-language-runtimes/tree/main/python) project from Wasm Labs.

Check our [examples](/examples) folders to see different workers using this kit.
