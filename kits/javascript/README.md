# Use it with JavaScript

The project already includes the compiled QuickJS engine. To simplify the usage of JS workers, the tool will automatically load this engine and will pass the source code with the request data.

This project is based on the [quickjs-wasm-rs](https://github.com/Shopify/javy/tree/main/crates/quickjs-wasm-rs) crate from Shopify.

Check our [examples](/examples) folders to see different workers using this kit.
