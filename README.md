Wasm Workers Server (`wws`) is an open source tool to **develop and run serverless applications server on top of WebAssembly**. The applications are composed by multiple modules called [_workers_](https://workers.wasmlabs.dev/docs/get-started/introduction#whats-a-worker). Each of these tiny modules is in charge of replying to a specific HTTP endpoint in your application.

When you start `wws`, it loads the existing workers in the given path or remote repository. You can write a worker in [different languages](https://workers.wasmlabs.dev/docs/languages/introduction) like Rust, JavaScript, Go, Ruby and Python. The filenames and folders determine the final routes that will be served. For example, the `index.js` will reply to the `/` endpoint.

## Getting started (5 minutes)

1. Download and install Wasm Worker Sever:

   ```shell
   curl -fsSL https://workers.wasmlabs.dev/install | bash
   ```

2. Create an `index.js` file with the following content:

    ```javascript
    addEventListener("fetch", event => {
      return event.respondWith(
        new Response("Hello from Wasm Workers Server!")
      );
    });
    ```

3. Run `wws`:

    ```shell
    $ wws .

    ```

4. Access to <http://127.0.0.1:8080>.

Congrats! You just created your first worker 🎉. From this point, you can explore the different examples and guides:

* [+20 Worker examples](./examples/)
* Guides to develop workers in different languages:
  * [Rust workers](https://workers.wasmlabs.dev/docs/languages/rust)
  * [Python workers](https://workers.wasmlabs.dev/docs/languages/python)
  * [Ruby workers](https://workers.wasmlabs.dev/docs/languages/ruby)
  * [Go workers](https://workers.wasmlabs.dev/docs/languages/go)
  * [JavaScript workers](https://workers.wasmlabs.dev/docs/languages/javascript)

### Run in a container

If you don't want to install anything locally you can just run `wws` from the `ghcr.io/vmware-labs/wws:latest` container image. You only need to mount your project in the `/app` folder:

```shell
docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/app -p 8080:8080 ghcr.io/vmware-labs/wws:latest
```

## Documentation

All our documentation is available at <https://workers.wasmlabs.dev>.

## Features

You can find all the available features [in the documentation](https://workers.wasmlabs.dev). It includes dynamic routes, an in-memory K/V store, etc.

## Language Support

Wasm Workers Server focuses on simplicity. We want you to run workers (written in different languages) safely in WebAssembly. For interpreted languages, we add different interpreters:

| Language | Support | Requires an external runtime | Issue |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Rust | ✅ | No | - |
| JavaScript | ✅ | No | - |
| Go | ✅ | No | [#95](https://github.com/vmware-labs/wasm-workers-server/issues/95) |
| Ruby | ✅ | [Yes](https://workers.wasmlabs.dev/docs/languages/ruby#installation) | [#63](https://github.com/vmware-labs/wasm-workers-server/issues/63) |
| Python | ✅ | [Yes](https://workers.wasmlabs.dev/docs/languages/python#installation) | [#63](https://github.com/vmware-labs/wasm-workers-server/issues/63) |
| Zig | ✅ | Yes | [#144](https://github.com/vmware-labs/wasm-workers-server/issues/144) |
| PHP | 🚧 | No | [#100](https://github.com/vmware-labs/wasm-workers-server/issues/100) |

To get more information about multi-language support in Wasm Workers Server, [check our documentation](https://workers.wasmlabs.dev/docs/languages/introduction).

## Development

### Prerequisites

To work with this project you will need to install:

* [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
* Make
* [NodeJS](https://nodejs.dev)

### Run the project

After installing the different prerequisites, you can run the development environment with:

```
$ cargo run -- --help
```

Wasm Workers Server is split into different Rust crates. The root project produces the `wws`, while every crate provides specific features.
