# Static assets

Wasm Workers Server allows you to serve any static asset required by your workers. For that, place any static asset in a `public` folder. It must be present in the root of the directory you're serving with `wws`.

Note that all static assets are mounted on `/`, so `public` won't be present in their paths.

For example, given the following folder structure:

```bash
.
├── index.js
└── public
    └── images
       └── intro.jpg
    └── robots.txt
```

If you run `wws` in this folder, it will serve the following resources:

* `/`: the response will be generated by the `index.js` worker
* `/robots.txt`: the static `robots.txt` file
* `/images/intro.jpg`: the static `intro.jpg` file
