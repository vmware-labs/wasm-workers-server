:::

Wasm Workers Server allows you to serve any static asset required by your workers. For that, place any static asset in a `public` folder. It must be present in the root of the directory you're serving with `wws`.

Note that all static assets are mounted on `/`, so `public` won't be present in their paths.

For example, given the following folder structure:

```bash
.
├── index.js
└── public
    └── images
       └── intro.jpg
    └── robots.txt
```

If you run `wws` in this folder, it will serve the following resources:

* `/`: the response will be generated by the `index.js` worker
* `/robots.txt`: the static `robots.txt` file
* `/images/intro.jpg`: the static `intro.jpg` file

## HTML files in public folder

HTML files are supported inside the `public` folder. `wws` will serve those without requiring the `html` extension.

For example, for the given folder structure:

```bash
.
├── index.js
└── public
    └── images
       └── intro.jpg
    └── about.html
```

The `about.html` file will be served as `/about`.

## Index file in public

An `index.html` can be added to the `public` folder and it will be mounted in `/`. Note that static files have a lower priority, so if there's an `/index.js` and `/public/index.html` files, the `/` route will be served by the former.
