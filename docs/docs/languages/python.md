# Python

The [Python](https://www.python.org/) interpreter is not embedded in Wasm Workers Server. To create workers based on this language, you first need to install a Python runtime.

Fortunately, we provide precompiled `python.wasm` modules in our [WebAssembly Language Runtimes](https://github.com/vmware-labs/webassembly-language-runtimes/) project, so the installation is simple.

## Run a Python example

1. Download `wws`:

    ```bash
    curl -fsSL https://workers.wasmlabs.dev/install | bash
    ```

2. Run the [python-basic](https://github.com/vmware-labs/wasm-workers-server/tree/main/examples/python-basic) example from the Wasm Workers Server's repository. The `-i` flag will install the Python runtime automatically.

    ```bash
    wws https://github.com/vmware-labs/wasm-workers-server.git -i --git-folder "examples/python-basic"
    ```

3. Access to <a href="http://localhost:8080/" target="_blank">http://localhost:8080</a>.

## Python runtime Installation

To install the Python Wasm module, run the following command:

```
wws runtimes install python latest
```

## Your first Python worker

Python workers are based on the [Request](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Request) / [Response](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response) objects from the Web Fetch API. Since these entities don't exist in the Python language, the worker includes a polyfill with these two classes. You can find the [polyfill code here](https://github.com/vmware-labs/wasm-workers-server/blob/main/metadata/repository/v1/files/python/3/poly.py).

In this example, the worker will get a request and print all the related information.

1. First, create a new `index.py` file with the following content. The `worker` method is mandatory as it will be the entrypoint for the worker:

    ```python title="./index.py"
    def worker(req):
        return Response("Hello from Python in WebAssembly!")
    ```

1. Now, you can add more content to the `worker` method to show the request information. In addition to that, let's add a response header.

    ```python title="./index.py"
    def worker(req):
        # Body response
        body = '''\
            <!DOCTYPE html>
            <body>
            <h1>Hello from Wasm Workers Server</h1>
            <p>Replying to {url}</p>
            <p>Method: {method}</p>
            <p>User Agent: {agent}</p
            <p>Payload: {body}</p>
            <p>
                This page was generated by a Python file inside WebAssembly
            </p>
            </body>
        '''.format(
            url=req.url,
            method=req.method,
            agent=req.headers["user-agent"],
            body=req.body
        )

        # Build a new response
        res = Response(body)

        # Add a new header
        res.headers["x-generated-by"] = "wasm-workers-server"

        return res
    ```

1. Save the file
1. If you didn't download the `wws` server yet, check our [Getting Started](../get-started/quickstart.md) guide.
1. [Install the Python runtime](#installation)
1. Run your worker with `wws`

    ```bash
    wws

        => index.py (name: default)
    🚀 Start serving requests at http://127.0.0.1:8080
    ```

1. Finally, open <http://127.0.0.1:8080> in your browser.

## Add a Key / Value store

Wasm Workers allows you to add a Key / Value store to your workers. Read more information about this feature in the [Key / Value store](../features/key-value.md) section.

To add a KV store to your worker, follow these steps:

1. First, create a `counter.py` file. It will access the KV store through the `Cache` object:

    ```python title="./counter.py"
    CACHE_KEY = "counter"

    def worker(request):
        count = Cache.get(CACHE_KEY)

        if count is None:
            count = 0
        else:
            count = int(count)

        # Body response
        body = '''\
            The counter value is: {count}
        '''.format(
            count=count
        )

        # Build a new response
        res = Response(body)

        # Update the counter
        Cache.set(CACHE_KEY, count + 1)

        return res
    ```

1. Create a `counter.toml` file with the following content. Note the name of the TOML file must match the name of the worker. In this case we have `counter.py` and `counter.toml` in the same folder:

    ```toml title="./counter.toml"
    name = "counter"
    version = "1"

    [data]
    [data.kv]
    namespace = "counter"
    ```

1. If you didn't download the `wws` server yet, check our [Getting Started](../get-started/quickstart.md) guide. You also need to install the Python runtime with the command below:

    ```plain
    wws runtimes install python latest
    ```

1. Save the file and run your worker with `wws`:

    ```bash
    wws

    ⚙️ Loading routes from: .
    🗺 Detected routes:
        - http://127.0.0.1:8080/counter
        => counter.py (name: default)
    🚀 Start serving requests at http://127.0.0.1:8080
    ```

1. Finally, open <http://127.0.0.1:8080/counter> in your browser.

## Dynamic routes

You can define [dynamic routes by adding route parameters to your worker files](../features/dynamic-routes.md) (like `[id].py`). To read them in Python, access to the `request.params` object:

```python
def worker(request):
    body = "The URL parameter is: {param}".format(
        param=request.params['id']
    )

    Response(body)
```

## Read environment variables

Environment variables are configured [via the related TOML configuration file](../features/environment-variables.md). These variables are directly injected as global constants in your worker. To read them, just use the same name you configured in your TOML file:

```toml title="./envs.toml"
name = "envs"
version = "1"

[vars]
MESSAGE = "Hello 👋! This message comes from an environment variable"
```

Now, you can read the `MESSAGE` environment variable using the Python `os` module:

```python title="./envs.py"
import os

def worker(req):
    # Body response
    body = "The environment variable value is: {message}".format(
        message=os.getenv("MESSAGE")
    )

    return Response(body)
```

If you prefer, you can configure the environment variable value dynamically by following [these instructions](../features/environment-variables.md#inject-existing-environment-variables).
