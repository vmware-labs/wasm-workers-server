# Go

Go workers are compiled into a WASI module using [TinyGo](https://tinygo.org/docs/guides/webassembly/). Then, they are loaded by Wasm Workers Server and start processing requests.

## Your first Go worker

Workers can be implemented either as an [http.Handler](https://pkg.go.dev/net/http#Handler) or an [http.HandlerFunc](https://pkg.go.dev/net/http#HandlerFunc).

In this example, the worker will get a request and print all the related information.

1. Create a new Go mod project

    ```
    go mod init workers-in-go
    ```

1. Add the Wasm Workers Server Go dependency

    ```
    go get -u github.com/vmware-labs/wasm-workers-server/kits/go/worker
    ```

1. Create a `worker.go` file with the following contents:

    ```go title="worker.go"
    package main

    import (
	    "net/http"

	    "github.com/vmware-labs/wasm-workers-server/kits/go/worker"
    )

    func main() {
        worker.ServeFunc(func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
            w.Header().Set("x-generated-by", "wasm-workers-server")
            w.Write([]byte("Hello wasm!"))
        })
    }
    ```

1. Additionally, you can now go further add all the information from the received `http.Request`:

    ```go title="worker.go"
    package main

    import (
        "fmt"
        "io"
        "net/http"

        "github.com/vmware-labs/wasm-workers-server/kits/go/worker"
    )

    func main() {
        worker.ServeFunc(func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
            var payload string

            reqBody, err := io.ReadAll(r.Body)
            if err != nil {
                panic(err)
            }
            r.Body.Close()

            if len(reqBody) == 0 {
                payload = "-"
            } else {
                payload = string(reqBody)
            }

            body := fmt.Sprintf("<!DOCTYPE html>"+
                "<head>"+
                "<title>Wasm Workers Server</title>"+
                "<meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width,initial-scale=1\">"+
                "<meta charset=\"UTF-8\">"+
                "<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/water.css@2/out/water.css\">"+
                "<style>"+
                "body { max-width: 1000px; }"+
                "main { margin: 5rem 0; }"+
                "h1, p { text-align: center; }"+
                "h1 { margin-bottom: 2rem; }"+
                "pre { font-size: .9rem; }"+
                "pre > code { padding: 2rem; }"+
                "p { margin-top: 2rem; }"+
                "</style>"+
                "</head>"+
                "<body>"+
                "<main>"+
                "<h1>Hello from Wasm Workers Server 👋</h1>"+
                "<pre><code>Replying to %s<br>"+
                "Method: %s<br>"+
                "User Agent: %s<br>"+
                "Payload: %s</code></pre>"+
                "<p>"+
                "This page was generated by a Go file running in WebAssembly."+
                "</p>"+
                "</main>"+
                "</body>", r.URL.String(), r.Method, r.UserAgent(), payload)

            w.Header().Set("x-generated-by", "wasm-workers-server")
            w.Write([]byte(body))
        })
    }
    ```

1. In this case, you need to compile the project to Wasm ([WASI](https://wasi.dev/)). To do this, make sure you have installed the TinyGo compiler by following the steps [here](https://tinygo.org/getting-started/install/):

    ```bash
    tinygo build -o worker.wasm -target wasi worker.go
    ```

1. Run your worker with `wws`. If you didn't download the `wws` server yet, check our [Getting Started](../get-started/quickstart.md) guide.

    ```bash
    wws .

    ⚙️ Loading routes from: .
    🗺 Detected routes:
    - http://127.0.0.1:8080/worker
    => worker.wasm (name: default)
    🚀 Start serving requests at http://127.0.0.1:8080
    ```

1. Finally, open <http://127.0.0.1:8080/worker> in your browser.

## Add a Key / Value store

Wasm Workers allows you to add a Key / Value store to your workers. Read more information about this feature in the [Key / Value store](../features/key-value.md) section.

To add a KV store to your worker, follow these steps:

1. Create a new Go project:

    ```bash
    go mod init worker-kv
    ```

1. Add the Wasm Workers Server Go dependency

    ```
    go get -u github.com/vmware-labs/wasm-workers-server/kits/go/worker
    ```

1. Create a `worker-kv.go` file with the following contents:

    ```go title="worker-kv.go"
    package main

    import (
	    "net/http"

	    "github.com/vmware-labs/wasm-workers-server/kits/go/worker"
    )

    func main() {
        worker.ServeFunc(func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
            w.Header().Set("x-generated-by", "wasm-workers-server")
            w.Write([]byte("Hello wasm!"))
        })
    }
    ```

1. Then, let's read a value from the cache and update it:

    ```go title="worker-kv.go"
    package main

    import (
        "fmt"
        "net/http"
        "strconv"

        "github.com/vmware-labs/wasm-workers-server/kits/go/worker"
    )

    func main() {
        worker.ServeFunc(func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
            cache, _ := r.Context().Value(worker.CacheKey).(map[string]string)

            var countNum uint32

            if count, ok := cache["counter"]; ok {
                n, _ := strconv.ParseUint(count, 10, 32)
                countNum = uint32(n)
            }

            body := fmt.Sprintf("<!DOCTYPE html>"+
                "<body>"+
                "<h1>Key / Value store in Go</h1>"+
                "<p>Counter: %d</p>"+
                "<p>This page was generated by a Wasm module built from Go.</p>"+
                "</body>", countNum)

            cache["counter"] = fmt.Sprintf("%d", countNum+1)

            w.Header().Set("x-generated-by", "wasm-workers-server")
            w.Write([]byte(body))
        })
    }
    ```

1. Compile the project to Wasm ([WASI](https://wasi.dev/)):

    ```bash
    tinygo build -o worker-kv.wasm -target wasi worker-kv.go
    ```

1. Create a `worker-kv.toml` file with the following content. Note the name of the TOML file must match the name of the worker. In this case we have `worker-kv.wasm` and `worker-kv.toml` in the same folder:

    ```toml title="worker-kv.toml"
    name = "workerkv"
    version = "1"

    [data]
    [data.kv]
    namespace = "workerkv"
    ```

1. Run your worker with `wws`. If you didn't download the `wws` server yet, check our [Getting Started](../get-started/quickstart.md) guide.

    ```bash
    wws .

    ⚙️ Loading routes from: .
    🗺 Detected routes:
    - http://127.0.0.1:8080/worker-kv
    => worker-kv.wasm (name: default)
    🚀 Start serving requests at http://127.0.0.1:8080
    ```

1. Finally, open <http://127.0.0.1:8080/worker-kv> in your browser.

## Dynamic routes

You can define [dynamic routes by adding route parameters to your worker files](../features/dynamic-routes.md) (like `[id].wasm`). To read them in Go, follow these steps:

1. Use the `worker.ParamsKey` context value to read in the passed in parameters:

    ```go title="main.go"
    package main

    import (
        "fmt"
        "net/http"

        "github.com/vmware-labs/wasm-workers-server/kits/go/worker"
    )

    func main() {
        worker.ServeFunc(func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
            params, _ := r.Context().Value(worker.ParamsKey).(map[string]string)
            ...
        })
    }
    ```

1. Then, you can read the values as follows:

    ```go title="main.go"
    package main

    import (
        "fmt"
        "net/http"

        "github.com/vmware-labs/wasm-workers-server/kits/go/worker"
    )

    func main() {
        worker.ServeFunc(func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
            params, _ := r.Context().Value(worker.ParamsKey).(map[string]string)
            id := "the value is not available"

            if val, ok := params["id"]; ok {
                id = val
            }

            w.Header().Set("x-generated-by", "wasm-workers-server")
            w.Write([]byte(fmt.Sprintf("Hey! The parameter is: %s", id)))
        })
    }
    ```

## Read environment variables

Environment variables are configured [via the related TOML configuration file](../features/environment-variables.md). These variables are accessible via `os.Getenv` in your worker. To read them, just use the same name you configured in your TOML file:

```toml title="envs.toml"
name = "envs"
version = "1"

[vars]
MESSAGE = "Hello 👋! This message comes from an environment variable"
```

Now, you can read the `MESSAGE` variable using the [`os.Getenv`](https://pkg.go.dev/os#Getenv) function:

```go title="envs.go"
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"net/http"
	"os"

	"github.com/vmware-labs/wasm-workers-server/kits/go/worker"
)

func main() {
	worker.ServeFunc(func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
		body := fmt.Sprintf("The message is: %s", os.Getenv("MESSAGE"))

		w.Header().Set("x-generated-by", "wasm-workers-server")
		w.Write([]byte(body))
	})
}

```

If you prefer, you can configure the environment variable value dynamically by following [these instructions](../features/environment-variables.md#inject-existing-environment-variables).
