# JavaScript

Workers based on JavaScript work out of the box with Wasm Workers Server. The server integrates a JavaScript interpreter compiled into a WebAssembly module. Currently, the interpreter we support is [quickjs](https://bellard.org/quickjs/) and we are working on adding new ones.

## Run a JavaScript example

1. Download `wws`:

    ```shell-session
    curl -fsSL https://workers.wasmlabs.dev/install | bash
    ```

2. Run the [js-basic](https://github.com/vmware-labs/wasm-workers-server/tree/main/examples/js-basic) example from the Wasm Workers Server's repository:

    ```shell-session
    wws https://github.com/vmware-labs/wasm-workers-server.git -i --git-folder "examples/js-basic"
    ```

3. Access to <a href="http://localhost:8080/" target="_blank">http://localhost:8080</a>.

## Your first JavaScript worker

JavaScript workers are based on the [Request](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Request) / [Response](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response) objects from the Web Fetch API. Your worker needs to listen to the `fetch` event, which will include an associated `Request` object. The worker function will receive the request and generate a `Response` object to reply to the request.

In this example, the worker will get a request and print all the related information.

1. First, create a new `index.js` file with the following content. It is the minimum code you need to subscribe to the fetch event and return a valid response.

    ```javascript title="./index.js"
    const reply = (request) => {
      return new Response("Hello Wasm!");
    }

    // Subscribe to the Fetch event
    addEventListener("fetch", event => {
      return event.respondWith(reply(event.request));
    });
    ```

1. Now, you can add more content to the `reply` function to show the request information. In addition to that, let's add a response header.

    ```javascript title="./index.js"
    const reply = (request) => {
      // Body response
      const body = `<!DOCTYPE html>
        <body>
        <h1>Hello from Wasm Workers Server</h1>
        <p>Replying to ${request.url}</p>
        <p>Method: ${request.method}</p>
        <p>User Agent: ${request.headers.get("userAgent")}</p>
        <p>Payload: ${request.body || "-"}</p>
        <p>
            This page was generated by a JavaScript file inside WebAssembly
        </p>
        </body>`;

      // Build a new response
      let response = new Response(body);

      // Add a new header
      response.headers.set("x-generated-by", "wasm-workers-server");

      return response;
    }

    // Subscribe to the Fetch event
    addEventListener("fetch", event => {
      return event.respondWith(reply(event.request));
    });
    ```

1. Save the file and run your worker with `wws`. If you didn't download the `wws` server yet, check our [Getting Started](../get-started/quickstart.md) guide.

    ```bash
    wws

    ⚙️ Loading routes from: .
    🗺 Detected routes:
    - http://127.0.0.1:8080/
    => index.js (name: default)
    🚀 Start serving requests at http://127.0.0.1:8080
    ```

1. Finally, open <http://127.0.0.1:8080> in your browser.

## Add a Key / Value store

Wasm Workers allows you to add a Key / Value store to your workers. Read more information about this feature in the [Key / Value store](../features/key-value.md) section.

To add a KV store to your worker, follow these steps:

1. First, create a `counter.js` file. It will access the KV store through the `Cache` object:

    ```javascript title="./counter.js"
    const CACHE_KEY = "counter";

    const reply = (request) => {
        let counter = Cache.get(CACHE_KEY) || 0;
        counter += 1;

        Cache.set(CACHE_KEY, counter);

        return new Response(`Counter: ${counter}`);
    }

    addEventListener("fetch", event => {
        event.respondWith(reply(event.request));
    });
    ```

1. Create a `counter.toml` file with the following content. Note the name of the TOML file must match the name of the worker. In this case we have `counter.js` and `counter.toml` in the same folder:

    ```toml title="./counter.toml"
    name = "counter"
    version = "1"

    [data]
    [data.kv]
    namespace = "counter"
    ```

1. Save the file and run your worker with `wws`. If you didn't download the `wws` server yet, check our [Getting Started](../get-started/quickstart.md) guide.

    ```bash
    wws

    ⚙️ Loading routes from: .
    🗺 Detected routes:
    - http://127.0.0.1:8080/counter
    => counter.js (name: default)
    🚀 Start serving requests at http://127.0.0.1:8080
    ```

1. Finally, open <http://127.0.0.1:8080/counter> in your browser.

## Send an HTTP request (fetch)

Wasm Workers allows you to send HTTP requests from your workers. Read more information about this feature in the [HTTP Requests](../features/http-requests.md) section.

To perform HTTP requests from your worker, follow these steps:

1. First, create an `index.js` file. It will call the [{JSON} Placeholder API](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) using the [fetch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) method:

    ```javascript title="./index.js"
    const reply = async (_req) => {
        // Body response
        let body;

        try {
            let res = await fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1');
            let json = await res.json();

            // Build a new response.
            // Add some basic sanitization
            body = `<!DOCTYPE html>
            <head>
              <title>JSON Placeholder request</title>
              <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,initial-scale=1">
              <meta charset="UTF-8">
            </head>
            <body>
              <main>
                <h1>Hello from Wasm Workers Server 👋</h1>
                <p>The post title is: ${json.title}</p>
              </main>
            </body>`;
        } catch (e) {
          body = `There was an error with the request: ${e}`;
        }

        return new Response(body);
    }

    addEventListener("fetch", event => {
        event.respondWith(reply(event.request));
    });
    ```

1. Create an `index.toml` file with the following content. It enables the worker to perform HTTP requests to that host given that, by default, HTTP requests are forbidden.

  Note the name of the TOML file must match the name of the worker. In this case we have `index.js` and `index.toml` in the same folder:

    ```toml title="./index.toml"
    name = "fetch"
    version = "1"

    [features]
    [features.http_requests]
    allowed_methods = ["GET"]
    allowed_hosts = ["jsonplaceholder.typicode.com"]
    ```

1. Save the file and run your worker with `wws`. If you didn't download the `wws` server yet, check our [Getting Started](../get-started/quickstart.md) guide.

    ```shell-session
    wws

    ```

1. Finally, open <http://127.0.0.1:8080> in your browser.

## Dynamic routes

You can define [dynamic routes by adding route parameters to your worker files](../features/dynamic-routes.md) (like `[id].js`). To read them in JavaScript, access to the `req.params` object:

```js
/**
 * Builds a reply to the given request
 */
const reply = (req) => {
  // Build a new response
  return new Response(`Hey! I got this parameter: ${req.params.id}`);
}

// Subscribe to the Fetch event
addEventListener("fetch", event => {
  return event.respondWith(reply(event.request));
});
```

## Read environment variables

Environment variables are configured [via the related TOML configuration file](../features/environment-variables.md). These variables are directly injected as global constants in your worker. To read them, just use the same name you configured in your TOML file:

```toml title="./envs.toml"
name = "envs"
version = "1"

[vars]
MESSAGE = "Hello 👋! This message comes from an environment variable"
```

Now, you can use the `MESSAGE` constant directly:

```javascript title="./envs.js"
const reply = (request) => {
  // Body response
  const body = JSON.stringify({
    success: true,
    // Here you can read the constant directly
    message: MESSAGE
  }, null, 2);

  // Build a new response
  let response = new Response(body, {
    headers: {
      "content-type": "application/json;charset=UTF-8"
    }
  });

  return response;
}

// Subscribe to the Fetch event
addEventListener("fetch", event => {
  return event.respondWith(reply(event.request));
});
```

If you prefer, you can configure the environment variable value dynamically by following [these instructions](../features/environment-variables.md#inject-existing-environment-variables).
